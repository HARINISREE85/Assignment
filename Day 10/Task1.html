        <p>Apple is one of the most popular and loved fruits in the world. It is round in shape and comes in various
            colors like red, green, and yellow. Apples have a sweet or slightly sour taste depending on the type. They
            belong to the Rosaceae family, and their scientific name is Malus domestica. Apples grow on trees that are
            mainly found in cool and temperate regions. The fruit has smooth skin and a juicy inside, with small brown
            seeds in the center. Apples are rich in vitamins and minerals, especially Vitamin C and dietary fiber, which
            help boost immunity and support digestion. The saying “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” reminds us of
            its great health benefits. Apples are low in calories, making them a healthy snack for everyone.

            There are thousands of apple varieties found across the world. Some popular types include Fuji, Gala, Red
            Delicious, and Granny Smith. Fuji and Gala <h1 id="a1">Harini sree K</h1> apples are sweet, while Granny Smith apples are green and tangy.
            Red Delicious apples are large, bright, and juicy. Apples can be eaten raw, or used in various dishes like
            pies, salads, jams, and juices. Apple pie and apple juice are loved by people of all ages. Dried apples and
            apple cider are also popular products.

            Apple trees bloom in spring with beautiful pink and white flowers. Bees play an important role in
            pollinating these flowers. After pollination, the fruit grows and ripens during the summer, and the apples
            are harvested in autumn. Apple trees can live for many years and produce fruit season after season. The top
            apple-producing countries are China, the United States, and India. In India, apples are mostly grown in the
            hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttarakhand.
           Apples grow best in well-drained soil and need plenty of sunlight. They are a symbol of health, freshness,
            and beauty. The fruit is not only delicious but also highly nutritious, filled with antioxidants and water
            that keep the body hydrated. Eating apples regularly helps improve heart health, reduces the risk of
            diabetes, and promotes glowing skin. Truly, the apple is a gift of nature — tasty, healthy, and refreshing,
            making it one of the most loved fruits on Earth.
