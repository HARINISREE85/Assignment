    <h3><em><strong>Video games:</strong></em></h3>
    <p><small>Many Japanese-only video games based on Doraemon have been developed. For instance, in 1983, Bandai developed Dokodemo Dorayaki Doraemon (どこでも ドラヤキ ドラえもん), an arcade game inspired by Pac-Man.[141] Doraemon, a NES video game made by Hudson Soft, was released on December 12, 1986,[142] and became one of the best-selling games of that year in Japan with over 1.15 million copies sold.[143] On December 6, 2007, Sega published Doraemon Wii, the first Doraemon video game released on Wii.[144] Doraemon can also be seen in Namco's Taiko no Tatsujin rhythm game series, such as in Taiko no Tatsujin: Sesson de Dodon ga Don! (2017).[145] The first Doraemon game to receive a Western release was Doraemon Story of Seasons (2019).[146][147] Card games with Doraemon themes have also been made in several special occasions, sometimes to exploit the popularity of feature films.[148] In 2016, a special edition of Uno about the series' characters was released exclusively in Japan, as a result of a cooperation between Asatsu-DK and Mattel.[149] In April 2025, CTW announced Doramonn Comic Traveler (ドラえもん コミックトラベラー), the first online browser game based on the series, on its gaming platform G123.[150]</small> </p>

    <p>In Japan, the Doraemon merchandising rights belong to Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions, which has produced and distributed a wide range of products under its brand, such as toys, food, stationery, action figures,[151] gashapon, shoes, clothing, and others.[152][153] Several companies have collaborated on the creation and distribution of products on the series and its characters, including Sanrio,[154] Converse,[155] Moleskine,[156] and ESP Guitars, which has made guitars decorated with Doraemon characters;[157] a further partnership of Doraemon with Uniqlo led to a line of clothing designed by Takashi Murakami.[158] The Doraemon franchise has also collaborated with various Japanese brands, including Tsi Groove & Sports's Jack Bunny!! golf apparel brand,[159][160][161] Unicharm's MamiPoko diaper brand,[162] and the video games LINE Pop 2,[163] Monster Strike,[164] and Granblue Fantasy.[165][166] Viz Media owns the Doraemon merchandising rights in North and Latin America,[1] which has developed Doraemon-themed clothing and collectibles in collaboration with retail chain Hot Topic,[167] and themed Happy Meals in a 2015 collaboration with McDonald's.[168] Viz Media Europe (now Crunchyroll EMEA) manages the merchandising in Europe except Spain and Portugal;[169] LUK International has obtained licenses in these two countries.[170]

Characters from Doraemon have been used in advertising through specific agreements with Shogakukan. For instance, following the Cool Japan initiative promoted by the Japanese government, Sharp Corporation produced a series of commercials featuring the characters of Doraemon and Nobita, which were broadcast in several ASEAN countries.[171] In late 2011, Shogakukan and Toyota Motor Corporation joined forces to create a series of live-action commercials as part of Toyota's ReBorn ad campaign, which depicted the manga's characters two decades after being grown up, where Hollywood actor Jean Reno played Doraemon.</p>
